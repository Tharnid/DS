Data Science Explorations

### Descriptive Statistics
---

- Describe data
- Summarize data
	- Minimum - lowest value in column
	- 1st quartile - cuts of first 25%
	- Median - value that separates the 1st half from the second half
	- Mean - avg of all values of column
	- 3rd Quartile - cut value of 75%
	- Maximum - highest value

#### Statistical Terms
---
**Observations**

	rows in a table

**Variables**

	column headings

**Qualitative Variable**

	catogorical values
	nominal values - named values

**Quantitative Variable**

	numeric values
	posses natural sense of order

### Uinvariate Analysis
---

	Single variable analysis

#### Qualitative Analysis
---

**Frequency**

	observations that occured in a certain category

**Percentage**

	Part of the whole

**Mode**

	Category containing the most observations of the variable

#### Quantitative Analysis
---

- analysis of a single numerical value

**Location**

	Measures of central tendency
	Mean
	Median
	Mode (most frequently occuring)

**Spread**

	Measures of dispersion
	Minimum of the variable and the maximum of the variable
	Range - difference between min and max
	Quartiles - points where data are divided in to four equal partitions
	Variance - measure of how far values are spread out
	Standard deviation - square root of variance
	Skewness - measure of the asymetry  
	Kurtosis - how sharply peaked or relatively flat

**Shape**

	for a single variable


### Bivariate Analysis
---

#### Qualitative Bivariate Analysis
---
- two variable analysis - of two categorical variables

- **Joint Frequency** - freq of occurences of the observations at intersection of two categories (contingency table)
- ** Contigency Table** - often referred to as a frequency table, a two way table, or a cross tabulation matrix
- **Joint percentage**  
- **Marginal Frequency** 

#### Quantitative Bivariate Analysis
---

- analysis of two numeric variables

- **Relationship**
- **Covariance** 
- **Correlation**  
- **Quatitative measures** - 
- **Partitionedby categaory** - compare one category to the next

### Guidance
---
1. Clean Data before starting
2. Understand the data of the domain
3. Understand bias - important to understand and how they affect results - cognitive, statistical, and contextual
4. Reproducible - if anyone questions results are data should be able to produce it
5. Understand implications
6. Know your limitations - do not perform analysis on something you are not trained in
